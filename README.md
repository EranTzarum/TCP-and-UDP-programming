## ## Final Network project

In this project we solved like problems in TCP programming and UDP programming.

## UDP programming

# Problem 1: Learn to use datagram sockets by example

Read and understand programs send_udp.c and recv_udp.c.
First, run recv_udp (note that this program contains an infinite loop, so you will want to put in the background with & so you can have your shell prompt back, or just open another terminal window). 
Then, run send_udp several times, passing localhost as command line parameter, and observe what happens. 

The func *void printsin(struct sockaddr_in *sin, char *pname, char* msg)
will print the string indicated by pname, print the string indicated by msg,
then the string "ip= " follow by the IP address of the host and finally the string "port= " followed by the port number.

# Problem 2: Create a gateway process that simulates datagram loss


source.c :Â  Takes the name of a host on the command line, creates a datagram socket to that host (each student will be assigned their own port number P to use), then enters an infinite loop in each iteration of which it sends a datagram onto the socket carrying in its body an integer number, increments the integer, then sleeps for one second only to repeat the cycle upon waking up.

gateway.c : Takes the name of a host on the command line and creates a datagram socket to that host (using port number P+1), it also creates another datagram socket where it can receive datagrams from any host on port number P; next, it enters an infinite loop in each iteration of which it receives a datagram from port P, then samples a random number using ((float)random())/((float)RAND_MAX) - if the number obtained is greater than 0.5, the datagram received is forwarded onto the outgoing socket to port P+1, otherwise the datagram is discarded and the process goes back to waiting for another incoming datagram. Note that this gateway will simulate an unreliable network that loses datagrams with 50% probability.

sink.c : Is almost identical to recv_udp.c, that means, it creates a socket to receive datagrams from any host on port P+1, then enters an infinite loop where it receives a datagram and prints to the screen the information of where the datagram came from (you can print the IP address in dotted-decimal notation) and what message it contains.

## TCP programming

# Part A: IP addresses, hostnames and .... HTTP 

Review the programs net_server.c and net_client.c to be sure you understand them.

# Part B: A simple web client

The wget program allows you to fetch the contents of a URL and save it to a new file.
Main sources that we use to build web_client.c :
  https://shapeshed.com/unix-wget
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15337932/how-to-include-the-command-wget-on-my-c-source-code
  
  https://www.includehelp.com/c-programs/delete-a-specified-file-using-the-system-function.aspx
 
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2029103/correct-way-to-read-a-text-file-into-a-buffer-in-c


One problem we will face in building our simple web client is that of parsing URLs.

The program will run like this:

a. *The command-line argument should be a URL rather than a hostname*.

b. The program will create an HTML file named "index.html" with all the data from the website
 by using system() func whit wget commend.

c. Opening a FILE to read the index.html we got from system("wget 'web_address'") command.
    and Copeing the FILE index.html to a buffer (char* buffer) and printing it (2500 letters at a time).

d. Deleteing index.html by system("rm 'FILE name'") commend.

Run it yourself - you can use on any website
